# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# 
# In this notebook, we provide a comprehensive summary of the Data Science Tools and Ecosystem, offering insights into the essential tools and technologies shaping the field of data science.
# 

# # Data Science Languages Overview
# 
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python : Widely used for its simplicity, readability, and a rich ecosystem of libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
# 
# 2. R : Known for statistical computing and graphics, R is favored for its extensive statistical packages and visualization capabilities.
# 
# 3. SQL (Structured Query Language) : Essential for working with relational databases, allowing data scientists to query, analyze, and manipulate data stored in databases.
# 
# 4. Julia : Gaining popularity for its high-performance numerical and scientific computing, particularly in data-intensive and computational science.
# 
# 5. Scala : Often used with Apache Spark for distributed data processing, Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming features.
# 
# 
# 

# # Data Science Libraries Overview
# 
# Some of the commonly used libraries by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. NumPy : A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.
# 
# 2. Pandas : A powerful data manipulation and analysis library, offering data structures like DataFrame for efficient data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
# 
# 3. scikit-learn : A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
# 
# 4. Matplotlib : A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python, commonly used for plotting charts and graphs.
# 
# 5. TensorFlow : An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.
# 
# 6. Seaborn : Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library that provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
# 
# 7. Statsmodels : A library for estimating and testing statistical models, including linear and non-linear regression models, time-series analysis, and more.
# 
# 8. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) : A library for working with human language data, providing easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources.
# 
# 9. lxml : A library for processing XML and HTML documents. It provides a simple and efficient way to parse and manipulate structured data.
# 
# 10. Plotly : An interactive graphing library that enables the creation of interactive plots and dashboards, suitable for exploratory data analysis.

# # Arithmetic Expression Examples
# 
# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# 

# In[6]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
result = (3 * 4) + 5
result


# In[7]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours


# **Objectives:**
# 
# - List popular languages for Data Science.
# - Introduce common libraries used in Data Science.
# - Showcase development environment open source tools.
# - Explore examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
# - Demonstrate practical calculations like converting minutes to hours.
